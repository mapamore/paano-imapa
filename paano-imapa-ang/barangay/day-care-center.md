## Day Care Center

A barangay hall is the seat of local government for the barangay, the lowest elected administrative division of the Philippines, below that of a Philippine city or Philippine municipality.

The barangay officials will often hold office there. The elected barangay council, the Sangguniang Barangay, will also hold its meetings there.[^1]
