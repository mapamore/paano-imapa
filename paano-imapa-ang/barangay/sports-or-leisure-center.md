## Sports Center

A distinct facility where a range of sports take place within an enclosed area, often referred to as "covered court" where basketball equipment and markings are available, but may be made availabe for other sports like volleyball, sepak takraw, etc.

Apart from sports, these buildings may be used for social events as well, which technically makes them as community centres, too.[^1]
