## Barangay Hall

A barangay hall is the seat of local government for the barangay, the lowest elected administrative division of the Philippines, below that of a Philippine city or Philippine municipality.

The barangay captain, the head of the barangay government, will often hold office there. The elected barangay council, the Sangguniang Barangay, will also hold its meetings there.[^1]
